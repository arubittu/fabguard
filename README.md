you can find the layer file which has all the libraries here :- 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1c0BsFw8s1o6TNdolMeOW5Eecau8NV0nI?usp=sharing
you need to download it and upload it in a s3 bucket.
and then while creating a layer in lambda function just copy paste the s3 number and it will be attached.
